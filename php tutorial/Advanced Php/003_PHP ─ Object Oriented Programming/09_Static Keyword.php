Static Keyword : 

Declaring class members or methods as static makes them accessible without needing an
instantiation of the class. A member declared as static cannot be accessed with an
instantiated class object (though a static method can).

<?php
class Foo
{
 public static $my_static = 'foo';
 public function staticValue() {
 return self::$my_static;
 }
}
print Foo::$my_static . "\n";
$foo = new Foo();
print $foo->staticValue() . "\n";

?>
